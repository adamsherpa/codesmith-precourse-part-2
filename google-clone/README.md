# WELCOME TO THE PRECOURSE PART 2!!!

In part 2 of the precourse, you will be doing more JavaScript challenges while building a copy of the "Google" page and a more complex layout as seen on Twitter's "bootstrap" page.

If this is challenging, don't be worried! Getting used to the challenge will be a great asset to you in our program.

## You (STILL) Need To Know How To Use GitHub!

Please refer to the **"How do I get started"** section in [Github.md](https://github.com/CodesmithLLC/precourse-part-1/blob/master/GitHub.md#how-do-i-get-started) from precourse-part-1 if you need a refresher on how to fork and clone your repo.

## Style guide

Just like last time, we want you to continue to practice writing clean, readable, consistently styled code. This will make your code more attractive to hirers and it will make other developers more tempted to collaborate with you. Here at Codesmith we follow a custom styleguide based on [eslint recommended](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/). As before, simply navigate to the directory from the terminal (in this case 'precourse-part-2') and run `npm install` to locally install the specific linting configuration - this way you'll get automatic linting in any JavaScript files.

## Instructions For The Precourse Challenges:

We divided part 2 of the precourse challenges into three sections: [Google Clone](./google-clone), [Fundamentals](./fundamentals), and [Bootstrap Clone](./bootstrap-clone) clone. There are three separate folders for each of the challenges.

During the Google Clone challenge, you will be creating a copy of the "Google" home page using only HTML and CSS. In the Fundamentals challenge, you will be working on solidifying your JavaScript skills even further.

For the Bootstrap Clone challenge, you will be creating a professional layout using only HTML and CSS. Please read the "README.md" files inside the folders for further instructions about each challenge. Be creative with your project and show us that you want to have fun with programming. Good Luck!

## What do I do when I am done?

Please refer to the **"What do I do when I am done with a unit?"** section in [Github.md](https://github.com/CodesmithLLC/precourse-JSFundamentals/blob/master/GitHub.md/#what-do-i-do-when-i-am-done-with-a-unit) from precourse-part-1 if you need a refresher on how to fork and clone your repo.
